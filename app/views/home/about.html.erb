<h1>About</h1>
<p>We wanted a way to display our life goals –  our purposes and hearts desires – simply, visually, beautifully.  We also wanted to be able to share those goals with our friends and family – all our circles – to get those goals off the ground.  We created LifeKite so that our life goals aren’t stuck on a piece of paper in a drawer somewhere forgotten – but up and out in the world -- in vivid, tempting imagery before our eyes.  We created LifeKite so that our life goals are out where our people can see them and can send some wind our way.</p>
